# SAT-Scores
[This notebook](https://github.com/danieldiamond/SAT-Scores/blob/master/SAT_Scores.ipynb) serves as an example of exploratory data analysis on NY School SAT Scores. EDA is essential to any predictive modelling approaches as it enhances your domain knowledge and ultimately provides a deeper understanding of model predictions.  

The dataset was obtained from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4).
